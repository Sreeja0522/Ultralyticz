Vision Task using Pretrained Models (Ultralytics)
Objective

We aim to solve a real-world problem in the Computer Vision domain using pretrained models from the Ultralytics YOLO framework.
As the first step, we will install and test the ultralytics package in a virtual environment on a Linux system.

1. Setting up the Environment

Step 1: Create a virtual environment (i have used MiniConda)

conda create -n yolo python=3.10

Step 2: Activate the virtual environment
conda activate yolo

After activation, your terminal prompt showed (yolo) at the beginning.

(yolo) reeja123@SREEJACSE22HPPAVILLIONLAPTOP:/mnt/c/Users/Sreeja$

2. Installing Ultralytics

Refer to the official documentation for reference:
https://docs.ultralytics.com/quickstart/

Install the Ultralytics package using pip:

pip install ultralytics

3. Testing the Installation

Example 1: Object Detection

Run inference using a pretrained YOLOv8 model on an online image:

yolo predict model=yolov8n.pt source='https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg
'

This will:

Download the pretrained YOLOv8 model (yolov8n.pt)

Perform object detection on the provided image

Save the output (image with bounding boxes) inside the runs/predict/ directory

You can view the result using:

xdg-open runs/predict/bus.jpg

Example 2: Segmentation

For instance segmentation, use a segmentation model:

yolo predict model=yolov8n-seg.pt source='https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg
'

This will generate segmentation masks and labels on the same image.
The segmented output will also be stored in the runs/predict/ folder.

4. Verify Results

The model should detect multiple objects such as:

bus

person

traffic light

and assign bounding boxes or segmentation masks along with confidence scores.

5. Deactivating the Environment

Once testing is complete, deactivate the virtual environment:

deactivate

6. Next Steps

Test the model with additional images or datasets.

Try other YOLOv8 models such as detection, segmentation, or pose estimation.

Fine-tune pretrained models on a custom dataset to address a specific real-world vision problem.
